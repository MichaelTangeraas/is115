<h1>Module 5.2</h1>

<p>In module 5.2 we aim to look at the use of comments in our code.
    <br />
    By using comments in our code, we can ensure better developer experiances and overview of our code
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Semester project code</h2>
<p>To demonstrate this, we can take a look at the code that me and my code partner has written for our semester project.</p>

<h3><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/imttv/PHP_Booking_System/tree/main">Go to Github Repo</a></h3>

<p>We use comments all throughout our project, but for a specific example, <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/imttv/PHP_Booking_System/blob/main/classes/calender.php">click here!</a></p>

<p>In our code we have created informative comment blocks that explain the class, its functions and outcomes.
    <br />
    This is to ensure that we can easily read and understand the code, and to ensure that other developers can do the same.
    <br />
    <b>@param</b> is used to explain the parameters of a function, and <b>@return</b> is used to explain the return value of a function.
